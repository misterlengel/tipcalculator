<p>How much was the bill?</p>

<p><input type="text" id="bill"></p>
<!-- 
This line makes a text box on the page. 
The id is named so the Javascript knows exactly where to look for whatever is entered into the text box. -->

<p><button onclick="calcTip(document.getElementById('bill').value)">Calculate 20% Tip</button></p>
<!-- 
This is a button on the page. 
onclick means it is going to call a Javascript function when you click the button. 
calcTip is the name of the function.
document.getElementById('bill').value means look for the value of the id on the page called 'bill'. 
(document.getElementById('bill').value) is in parentheses because it is the value that is sent to the Javascript function.
'Calulate 20% Tip' is what will be written on the button.
-->


<p id="total"></p>
<!--
The id of this <p> is total. This allows the Javascript to look for this area on the page and write some HTML there.
-->

<script>

function calcTip(bill){
// This is the name of the function. In this case, bill = the value of the id called bill above.

	var totalBill = bill * 1.2
// This does the calculation. It takes bill and multiplies it by 1.2
// It then sets totalBill to that value.

	document.getElementById('total').innerHTML = totalBill;
// This is the opposite of document.getElementById('bill').value 
// It takes the value of total bill and PUSHES it to the HTML page. It looks for an id called total and puts it there.
